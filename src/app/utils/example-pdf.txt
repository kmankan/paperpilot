> ABSTRACT

We report the discovery of the first example of an Einstein zig-zag lens, an extremely rare lensing configuration. In this system, J1721 +8842, six images of the same background quasar are formed by two intervening galaxies, one at redshift z1 = 0.184 and a second one at z2 = 1.885. Two out of the six multiple images are deflected in opposite directions as they pass the first lens galaxy on one side, and the second on the other side – the optical paths forming zig-zags between the two deflectors. In this letter, we demonstrate that J1721 +8842, previously thought to be a lensed dual quasar, is in fact a compound lens with the more distant lens galaxy also being distorted as an arc by the foreground galaxy. Evidence supporting this unusual lensing scenario includes: 1- identical light curves in all six lensed quasar images obtained from two years of monitoring at the Nordic Optical Telescope; 2- detection of the additional deflector at redshift z2 = 1.885 in JWST /NIRSpec IFU data; and 3-a multiple-plane lens model reproducing the observed image positions. This unique configuration o ff ers the opportunity to combine two major lensing cosmological probes: time-delay cosmography and dual source-plane lensing since J1721 +8842 features multiple lensed sources forming two distinct Einstein radii of di ff erent sizes, one of which being a variable quasar. We expect tight constraints on H0 and w by combining these two probes on the same system. The z2 = 1.885 deflector, a quiescent galaxy, is also the highest-redshift strong galaxy-scale lens with a spectroscopic redshift measurement.

gravitational lensing: strong - cosmology: cosmological parameters - methods: data analysis 

1. Introduction 

Strong gravitational lensing is a powerful tool to measure dis-tances and ratios of distances in the Universe (Refsdal 1964). To date, two main methods have provided the most stringent con-straints on cosmological parameters. The first, time-delay cos-mography, uses the time delay between the arrival of di ff erent images of a variable lensed source (typically quasars or super-novae) to infer the time-delay distance , i.e. a ratio of distances, to the lens, to the source, and between the lens and the source (see e.g. Birrer et al. 2024, for a review). From these time-delay dis-tance measurements, the COSMOGRAIL, H0LiCOW, SHARP, STRIDES, and TDCOSMO collaborations have achieved a 2 to 8% measurement of the Hubble Constant ( H0), depending on the assumptions made to describe the mass profile of the deflector galaxy (Chen et al. 2019; Wong et al. 2020; Birrer et al. 2020; Millon et al. 2020; Shajib et al. 2020). The first discovered cases of supernovae lensed by galaxy clusters also allowed a 6% (Kelly et al. 2023; Grillo et al. 2024), and an 11% (Pascale et al. 2024) determination of H0, while the search for a galaxy-scale lens of a supernova suitable for time-delay cosmography is still ongoing. The second method uses double source-plane lenses (DSPL). This method leverages rare lensing configurations where two background objects are lensed by the same foreground galaxy, forming two Einstein rings of di ff erent radii (Gavazzi et al. 2008). The ratio of the two radii is proportional to ratios in-volving distances to the two sources and between the lens and the sources (see e.g. Collett et al. 2012, for details). These ra-tios of distances are not sensitive to H0 but constrain the expan-

sion history of the Universe and, thus, can provide competitive measurements of the matter density parameter, Ωm, and of the dark energy equation of state parameter, w (Collett & Auger 2014; Linder 2016). Although the presence of multiple back-ground sources is common for galaxy clusters, this information is needed to infer their complex mass distribution, which reduces the precision on the cosmological parameters (e.g. Jullo et al. 2010; Caminha et al. 2022). In contrast, galaxy-scale lenses tend to be very well fitted with simple mass distributions (e.g. Shajib et al. 2021; Sheu et al. 2024) but galaxy-scale DSPL are unfortu-nately extremely rare. Only six systems have been spectroscop-ically confirmed to date (Gavazzi et al. 2008; Tu et al. 2009; Tanaka et al. 2016; Schuldt et al. 2019; Lemon et al. 2023; Bo-lamperti et al. 2023), although several dozen should be found in wide-field surveys such as LSST or Euclid (Sharma et al. 2023). Until more galaxy-scale DSPL are found, this probe will remain limited by statistical errors due to the small sample size. Here, we present a unique case of galaxy-scale strong lens-ing, J1721 +8842, originally discovered as a quadruply-imaged source at redshift zs = 2.38 by Lemon et al. (2018) using 

Gaia and Pan-STARRS, which was subsequently interpreted as a lensed dual active galactic nucleus (dual-AGN) in Lemon et al. (2022) and Mangat et al. (2021) due to the presence of two ad-ditional images in follow-up data (labeled E and F in Fig. 1). We demonstrate in this letter that these six images are all from the the same background quasar, as made possible by another deflector at redshift z2 = 1.885 in addition to the known lens at redshift z1 = 0.184. This second deflector, contoured in white in Fig. 1, was previously mistaken for a source galaxy at the same redshift as the quasar, from which the black holes may have been ejected in a post-merger scenario (Mangat et al. 2021). Since the

The red lensed arc, previously believed to be the host galaxy of a second source quasar, is highlighted in white. This arc is actually an additional de-flector at an intermediate redshift, which is itself lensed by the central foreground galaxy in the image. The dotted red square indicates the footprint of the JWST /NIRSpec observation which enabled the mea-surement of the arc’s redshift.

more distant deflector is also lensed into a partial Einstein ring, J1721 +8842 qualifies as both a DSPL and a time-delay lens. This exceptional system provides a unique opportunity to com-bine the two major strong lensing probes mentioned above. In this letter, we present evidence from the light curves ob-tained at the Nordic Optical Telescope (NOT), new redshift mea-surements from the James Web Space Telescope ( JWST ) Near InfraRed Spectrograph (NIRSpec), and updated lens models, which unambiguously confirm the scenario where one single source is lensed in J1721 +8842. Full lens models, time-delay measurements and cosmology constraints derived from this sys-tem will be published in follow-up papers as part of the TD-COSMO collaboration (Schmidt et al. in prep., Dux et al. in prep., Millon et al. in prep.). Throughout this work, we adopt a flat ΛCDM cosmology with H0 = 70 km s −1 Mpc −1 and Ωm = 0.3. 

2. Evidence for single source lensing 

> 2.1. Identical light curves

J1721 +8842 was imaged daily in the r band for two full years at the NOT, from February 2021 to August 2023. It is circumpolar, allowing for continuous monitoring at the latitude of NOT. The general observation strategy and data reduction will be described in an upcoming paper, together with more targets monitored at the same facility. After the completion of the observations, the suspicion that J1721 +8842 is in fact a single quasar, arose from the light curves of the E and F lensed images, which match those of A, B, C and D (see Fig. 1 for the labeling of the lensed im-ages). For illustration, the D and E curves, shown in Fig. 2, dis-

play the same variations with a ∼35-day o ff set. This non-zero delay rules out extraction systematics, which would cause simul-taneous variations. This similarity contradicts the dual quasar hypothesis, in which the curves would be uncorrelated: if two quasars were present in the source plane, they would be sepa-rated by at least 6 kpc (Lemon et al. 2022), and thus it is impos-sible that one AGN would trigger a correlated emission in the second one. However, there might remain a possibility that two indepen-dently varying quasars could show variations matching within their noise envelopes, even though the odds seem slim over a long baseline. To assess these odds, we generated a million mocks for which we calculated the best correlation with the D curve with time shifts between −100 and +100 days. In doing so, we assumed that the variability of both quasars could be mod-eled with Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) processes, the parameters of which (correlation time τ and volatility σ) were fitted on the D curve. The best attained correlation was 0.91, translating to a re-semblance of low-frequency features, whereas D and E have a correlation of 0.95, with even high-frequency features matching. Thus, we failed to find a properly matching curve in one million draws. To assess how many mocks it would take to match even the higher-frequency features, we considered two identical OU processes initially di ff ering by a value within the noise envelope

.Using the cumulative distribution function of the normal distri-bution, Φ, we calculated the probability that the two processes remain within the noise envelope after ∆t days, given in Eq. (1) below.

We take ∆t ∼ 40 days as the size of the smallest clearly captured features, and we ob-tain the probability of observing two identical light curves from two independent quasars over this baseline to be about 10 −12 .This is assuming the ∆t ∼ − 35 days delay required for matching the two curves, but the existence of a delay is expected regard-less of the scenario, with moreover all six curves matching in a similar way with time shifts only. Furthermore, this all neglects the odds of two independent quasars have the same variability parameters. Overall, both numerical and analytical approaches indicate vanishing odds of two quasars producing light curves this similar over the 700 days monitoring baseline. 

> 2.2. Redshift of the red lensed arc

Lemon et al. (2018) first confirmed the four bright images (A, B, C, and D) to be at a redshift of 2.38, and subsequent long-slit spectroscopy confirmed image E to be at the same redshift, though the signal-to-noise ratio did not allow for any clear com-parison of the spectral features (Lemon et al. 2022). Image F was not directly measured, but was assumed to be the counter-image of E. We note that these analyses were done solely on ground-based imaging, and thus the arc seen in subsequent Hubble Space Telescope ( HST ) imaging (contoured in white in Fig. 1) was not used to conclude the dual-source nature of the system. Mangat et al. (2021) did use the HST imaging and suggested that the arc was another source galaxy, located at the same redshift as

the quasar. These authors noticed that the center position of this galaxy did not match with the position of any of the quasars and proposed the hypothesis that the quasars were recoiling black holes, ejected from their host galaxy after a merger. No redshift for the arc had been reported, and all previous lens modeling assumed a single lens plane. Thanks to a recent, deep JWST /NIRSpec (Jakobsen et al. 2022) observation 2, this hypothesis could finally be tested. The footprint of the JWST /NIRSpec observation is shown in Fig. 1, with a part of the red arc falling into the field of view. The extracted spectrum of the arc, and its extraction aperture on a slice of the NIRSpec cube, are displayed in the bottom part of Fig. 2. The spectrum features Balmer absorption lines that make a redshift determination straightforward: z2 = 1.885 ± 0.001 3.This is incompatible with the redshift of the background quasar, which can also be determined from the NIRSpec data: zF ∼

2.382 ± 0.002, in agreement with the results of Lemon et al. (2022). Therefore, rather than being the host galaxy of a second quasar, the arc is due to a separate galaxy, lensed by the fore-ground deflector at z1 = 0.184, and itself acting as a lens for the quasar light. At redshift z2 = 1.885, this is the highest redshift

spectroscopically-confirmed galaxy-scale lens known, breaking the previous record of z = 1.62, for a galaxy embedded in a cluster (Wong et al. 2014). Its redshift is also comparable to that of the lens found by van Dokkum et al. (2023), although only a photometric redshift ( z = 2.02 ± 0.02, Mercier et al. 2024) has been obtained for this system. 

2.3. Lens model 

Original models published by Schmidt et al. (2023) and Ertl et al. (2023) assumed two quasars in the source plane, and mod-eled the lensed arcs as one of the quasar host galaxies at red-shift zs = 2.38. However, Schmidt et al. (2023) observed some unexpectedly large astrometric errors for this system whereas Ertl et al. (2023) noted an o ff set between the quasar position and its host galaxy. This o ff set was also noticed in the mod-els by Mangat et al. (2021). In light of the new redshift mea-surement from the JWST /NIRSpec observations, we updated the lenstronomy (Birrer & Amara 2018; Birrer et al. 2021) model of Schmidt et al. (2023), adding this additional perturber at red-shift z2 = 1.885. The updated multi-plane lens model reproduces the positions of the six lensed images, matching the astrometry measured from HST imaging with a root-mean-squared error of

0.03 ′′ . The model includes a power-Law elliptical mass distribu-tion (PEMD) at z1 = 0.184 to describe the foreground lensing galaxy, a singular isothermal sphere (SIS) at z2 = 1.885, and ex-ternal shear. Additionally, we include four galaxies located be-tween 10 ′′ and 33 ′′ from the optical axis that are visible in the 

HST images. These perturbers do not have spectroscopic red-shift measurements but, given their color in the HST images, we assumed that they are located in the z1 = 0.184 lens plane. They are modeled as SIS profiles and have little impact on the total convergence. In Fig. 3, we show the magnification map of our lens model, alongside the predicted and observed image po-sitions and the optical paths taken by each lensed image. Both the ABCD quartet and the EF doublet are initially deflected by the z2 = 1.885 deflector, yet they still form two separate and compact groups of light rays at this redshift. Moreover, the two groups are separated by 0 .7′′ , which translates to a separation of 6 kpc, matching the reported distance between the two initially postulated quasar sources. Thus, not only does the model repro-duce the observational data, but it also qualitatively explains how the former hypothesis of two sources could be fitted so well with a single deflector. 

3. Discussion 

To our knowledge, the formation of six multiple images of the same background source has never been observed in galaxy-scale strong lenses. However, this lensing configuration was originally studied by Kochanek & Apostolakis (1988) and Erdl & Schneider (1993) (see also Möller & Blain 2001; Werner et al. 2008). More recent studies by Collett & Bacon (2016) predicted that such system could form “only if the second lens is multiply imaged by the first and the Einstein radius of the second lens is comparable to, but does not exceed that of the first” . J1721 +8842 fulfills these two conditions, as it is clear from the HST images that the most distant deflector is dou-bly imaged, with the main arc visible in the vicinity of image F and a counter-image close to image E. In addition, the Ein-stein radius of this deflector, inferred from our lens model, is 

θE,2 = 0.359 ± 0.014” translating to a total enclosed mass of 

M2 = (2 .31 ± 0.19) · 10 11 M⊙. This makes the more distant deflec-tor slightly less massive than the foreground one, whose Einstein radius is θE,1 = 1.744 ± 0.013”, corresponding to a total enclosed mass of M1 = (2 .74 ± 0.04) · 10 11 M⊙.The ray tracing of the multiple images, illustrated in the right panel of Figure 3, reveals the zig-zag formed by the two deflec-tors: image F passes by the far deflector on one side, then is re-focused by the foreground galaxy as it passes it on its other side. Image D also experiences two deflections in opposite directions. Additionally, the DPSL nature of this system, with two source planes and six measured time delays, might also par-tially lift the Mass-Sheet Degeneracy (MSD, Falco et al. 1985; Schneider & Sluse 2013), which currently is the main source of uncertainties in time-delay cosmography analyses. In recent works (e.g. Birrer et al. 2020; Shajib et al. 2023), a distinction has been made between the external MSD, attributed to the net lensing e ff ect of line-of-sight structures around the main lens – constrained by galaxy number counts (e.g. Rusu et al. 2017; Wells et al. 2023) or weak lensing analysis (Tihhonova et al. 2018, 2020) – and the internal MSD, interpreted as a subtle change of slope in the mass profile of the lensing galaxy, pos-sibly due to the presence of a cored dark matter component (see Blum et al. 2020; Blum & Teodori 2024, for details). The inter-nal MSD parameter λint , can be constrained with a measurement of the stellar kinematics of the lensing galaxy, ideally spatially resolved, which provides a second estimate of its mass profile. Although the MSD can be generalised for DSPLs (Schneider 2014a,b), it requires a very specific transformation in both lens planes to maintain an exact degeneracy leaving the lensing ob-

servables unchanged. According to Schneider (2014a), the e ff ect of a cored profile for the first deflector ( λint ,1 < 1) − equivalent to a positive convergence mass sheet − requires a mass sheet in the second lens plane with negative convergence ( λint ,2 > 1) to rescale only the time delays, and thus H0, while leaving other lensing observables una ff ected by this transformation. Although this is mathematically possible, such a combination of positive and negative mass sheets lacks a clear physical interpretation, as the model proposed by Blum & Teodori (2024) would re-quire some very specific fine-tuning of its redshift dependence to produce alternating cored and cusp profiles. The hypothe-sis made by recent hierarchical Bayesian analysis (Birrer et al. 2020) that a population of lenses should share common proper-ties for their mass profile (i.e., λint is drawn from a parent distri-bution common to all lensing galaxies, Birrer et al. 2020) might also break the double-source plane equivalent of the MSD. Two mass sheets with opposite sign would be disfavored under the aforementioned hypothesis. Whether all the available data can constrain both H0 and w simultaneously, even when considering maximally degenerate lensed models is left for the future mod-eling and cosmology papers on this lens. Collett & Bacon (2016) calculated the optical depth for such compound lensing events for varying source redshifts and for each number of images, finding the probability of six-image sys-tems at z > 2 to be ∼ 10 −8. This means that such Einstein zig-zag lens occurs once in 100 million line-of-sights. Comparing to the approximate optical depth of multiple lensing of quasars – 

∼ 10 −3.3 found by systematic lensed quasar searches (Oguri et al. 2012) – suggests that 1 in 50 000 lensed quasars should be a zig-zag lens, however only ∼ 300 such systems are known (Lemon et al. 2023). This naive approximation does not account for mag-nification bias, and further if we consider the optical depth to a compound lens with any number of images, the probability in-creases by a factor of 100. Given that recent large sky-surveys has now imaged several billions of galaxies, it is not surprising that such a system has been found, especially when considering that the high magnification of the some of the multiple images (ranging from 14 to 19 for image A, B and C) have made its detection easier. 

4. Conclusion 

We have shown that J1721 +8842 is not a lensed dual quasar as previously suggested, but rather a single quasar imaged six times by the combined gravitational deflections of two galaxies: one at 

z1 = 0.184, and another at z2 = 1.885. This scenario is consistent with all available data: identical light curves in all lensed images, a lens model that reproduces the HST images and the detection of an additional deflector, itself lensed, from JWST /NIRSpec spec-troscopy. This image configuration is extremely rare, with the optical path of two images, namely D and F, forming a zig-zag between the two deflectors. This is the first known example of an Einstein zig-zag lens. The source quasar of J1721 +8842 has a Proximate Damped Lyman-α (PDLA) system, which only about 1 in 3000 quasars have (Finley et al. 2013; Lemon et al. 2022). This characteristic, combined with its exceptional lensing configuration, will allow us to probe the PDLA along six di ff erent line-of-sight, o ff ering the possibility to study these rare systems on sub-parsec scales. In addition, we report that the lens at z2 = 1.885 is quiescent: its spectrum shows the presence of neutral hydrogen gas, but no emission lines typical of star formation. This deflector is similar in nature and redshift to that found by van Dokkum et al. (2023) and Mercier et al. (2024). To date, this is also the highest redshift strong galaxy lens confirmed with spectroscopy. A precise mass model of J1721 +8842 can answer questions about the compact-ness of this z2 = 1.885 lens, its dark matter fraction, and other questions studied by van Dokkum et al. (2023). Finally, the source galaxy of J1721 +8842 hosts a variable AGN and it is the most Northern gravitational lens known, which makes continuous monitoring from the ground possible. This has made the time-delay measurements between all six images possible. This system is therefore valuable for future H0 mea-surement through time-delay cosmography, where high-redshift lenses are known to provide tighter constraints on the cosmo-logical parameters (Paraficz & Hjorth 2009). Its DSPL nature is also advantageous: its lens model can also constrain ratio of distances between the observer, the lens and the two sources, al-lowing precise measure of the expansion history of the Universe, with particular sensitivity to the dark energy equation of state. By combining these two strong lensing probes on the same system, it will be possible to probe H0, w, and the mass profile of the higher redshift deflector, which is of interest for the population of massive galaxies at z ∼ 2.
